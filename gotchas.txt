1. 9/24/2018: Spent hours trying to figure out why I was getting  
     "Error: Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions."
   ...until I figured out by use of (typeof dispatchee) and
   dispatchee.constructor.name that I was dispatching JSON rather than an
   actual plain old JavaScript object...just to add to the confusion,
   unbeknownst to me, the fetch API's response.json() does not return JSON...but in fact
   parses the body text as JSON and returns a plain old JavaScript
   object...probably via JSON.parse()...of course, it makes much more
   sense to store the body as a string since that's what get sent over
   the wire...we don't sent JavaScript objects over the wire, do we,
   now...the body of the response is a string...although it is oft-times
   a JSON string...
