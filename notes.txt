...server needs to find ./service-worker.js

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41150430/how-to-register-service-worker-using-webpack

12/27/2019: Need to figure out how to serve the service-worker.js file from
   navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js') 
since everything goes into bundle.js...
...could we simply ask webpack to copy service-worker.js from ./src to ./dist?

   I found it easy to register a vanilla js service worker by putting it into its own file and
   adding it as an entry point in my webpack config. I would like to dive deeper into a react
   specific service worker which listens and re-renders a given component if an online/offline
   event is triggered. Like yourself i'm quite new to react and I'm wondering if redux is the
   way forward for this kind of behaviour. Redux is something I'm still struggling with though!

Or, since we're serving up index.html from the server, we could serve up
service-worker.js virtually from the server...or even do a dangerous hack
and have the server serve it up from ./src, but actually that would be
fatal since we are supposed to deploy only ./dist to production...
