1. fancy: Use HTML5 video in lieue of animated gif in 
    ./dist/assets/images/gold-brass-gear-cogs-animated-5.gif

2. Get rid of leftover stuff from treebuchet, etc. (to make istanbul say we're
   closer to 100% coverage)...then tweak tests to bring us closer to 100%
   coverage...

3. Add "end-to-end" tests for the REST API...(using actual node request objects
   and/or supertest for not quite end-to-end...)...we may be OK with using
   the actual database for these...(these may not _really_ be necessary
   since we're testing out the models themselves -- complete with DB
   connections, and also testing out the api's...but they are a good
   way to make sure everything's functioning REST-fully...)

4. Add full end-to-end tests with Jest and Puppeteer...

5. Add first filter -- description_filter 
        [x] dbmodels.test.js -- test that DB model filters by description
        [x] ObjectivesFilterForm.test.js -- test that description filter is
               passed in call to onObjectivesFilter...
