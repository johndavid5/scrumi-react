 To set a user's password (for now, the user must _already_ exist
 in the `users` table), call
      PUT /user_login_api
 passing in the username and password, and the password_hash will be
 set in the DB table.  See ./curl/set-password.bat

Once the user has a password, the login process has two steps:

1. You call POST /user_login_sessions_api, passing in username and password, to 
   authenticate the password and get a JWT.

2. You call GET /user_login_api with x-auth in the HTTP header set to 
   the JWT token, to get the currently logged-in userâ€™s information.
   (We authenticate the token, decode it, and look up the user info
    in the database.)
